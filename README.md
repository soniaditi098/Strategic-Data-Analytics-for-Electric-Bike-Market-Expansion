# Strategic-Data-Analytics-for-Electric-Bike-Market-Expansion
Welcome to the Strategic Data Analytics project for Electric Bike Market Expansion. This repository documents the development of a comprehensive data analytics pipeline designed to leverage Electric Bike sales data for market expansion and strategic insights.

## Project Overview

This project integrates a suite of technologies to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data, culminating in actionable business intelligence for the electric bike retail sector.

## Technologies Used
- **PostgreSQL**: Used for data storage and the execution of the initial ETL process.
- **PowerBI**: Utilized for creating dynamic and interactive dashboards for data visualization.
- **Power Query**: Employed within Power BI for advanced data transformation.
- **DAX**: Data Analysis Expressions used to define custom calculations in Power BI reports.

## Features

- ETL pipeline execution using **PostgreSQL** for robust data extraction and preparation.
- Data transformation with **Power Query** in Power BI for tailored data analysis requirements.
- Advanced analytics and visualization dashboards created in **Power BI** with **DAX** formulas.
- Interactive reporting to deliver insights into sales trends and customer demographics.

## Insights and Conclusions

1. **Revenue and Profit**: The company has generated a revenue of $19.50M and a profit of $10.06M. The data suggests a healthy profit margin overall.

2. **Purchases by Gender**: Purchases are almost evenly split between male and female customers, with a slight majority of male customers (50.3% male vs. 47.8% female).

3. **Profit Margin by Brand**: The profit margin distribution among different bike brands shows that OHM Cycles and WeAreA2B have the largest share, suggesting they may be the most profitable or popular brands in the offering.

4. **Revenue by Car Ownership**: The revenue from customers who own cars is nearly evenly split with those who do not own cars, indicating that car ownership is not a primary factor affecting bike purchases.

5. **Monthly Revenue Trend**: There is a noticeable peak in revenue in April, suggesting a seasonal trend or a successful campaign/promotion during that month.

6. **Customer Segmentation by Revenue**: The majority of revenue comes from the 'Mass Customer' wealth segment, which significantly outperforms the 'Affluent Customer' and 'High Net Worth' segments.

7. **Revenue by Customer**: Individual customer revenue indicates a variation in spending with some customers such as 'Jillie' and 'Fonz' contributing more significantly than others.
